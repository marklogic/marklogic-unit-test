  Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
  ==============================

  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
  LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
  CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  1. DEFINITIONS

  "Contribution" means:

  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
  distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent
  Contributor:

  i) changes to the Program, and

  ii) additions to the Program;

  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
  distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from
  a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or
  anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
  additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
  distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license
  agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
  necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
  combined with the Program.

  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
  Agreement.

  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
  including all Contributors.

  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
  reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
  distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
  such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
  Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
  transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
  object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
  Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
  Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
  covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
  other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
  licensed hereunder.

  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
  to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
  Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
  intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
  any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
  infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
  exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
  needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
  allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
  to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
  copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
  set forth in this Agreement.

  3. REQUIREMENTS

  A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
  its own license agreement, provided that:

  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

  b) its license agreement:

  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
  conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
  and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
  and fitness for a particular purpose;

  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
  damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
  damages, such as lost profits;

  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
  by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
  Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on
  or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

  When the Program is made available in source code form:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
  the Program.

  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
  if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
  the originator of the Contribution.

  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
  respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
  intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
  includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
  manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
  Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
  offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
  and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
  losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
  lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
  Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
  Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in
  a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
  to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
  property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
  a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
  b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
  Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
  negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim
  at its own expense.

  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
  offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
  that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
  warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
  such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
  Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
  Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
  court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
  Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

  5. NO WARRANTY

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
  AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
  CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
  associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but
  not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
  applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
  unavailability or interruption of operations.

  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
  CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
  SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
  LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
  CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
  ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
  EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
  OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  7. GENERAL

  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
  remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
  parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
  necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
  (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
  infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
  under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
  comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
  does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
  aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
  terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
  soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
  Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
  continue and survive.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
  order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
  modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
  publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
  time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
  Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
  Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
  Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
  be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
  Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
  Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
  the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
  (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
  stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
  licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
  Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All
  rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
  intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
  Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
  after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
  in any resulting litigation.

  Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
  ==============================

  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
  LICENSE (“AGREEMENT”). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
  CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.


  1. DEFINITIONS
  --------------

  “Contribution” means:

    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed
    under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

      i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program;

    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
    Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution “originates”
    from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor
    itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not
    include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.

  “Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

  “Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
  necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
  combined with the Program.

  “Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
  Agreement.

  “Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any
  Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

  “Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form,
  that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial
  revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a
  whole, an original work of authorship.

  “Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
  results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents
  of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source
  Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not
  include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes,
  structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to,
  bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.

  “Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any
  manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

  “Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications,
  including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and
  configuration files.

  “Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0,
  or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional
  permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.


  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
  ------------------

    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
    Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
    such Derivative Works. b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
    Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
    royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
    offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
    Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license
    shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
    the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
    Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents.
    The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include
    the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c) Recipient
    understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its
    Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
    Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
    intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
    disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
    based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
    condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
    Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
    intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
    patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it
    is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing
    the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
    sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
    copyright license set forth in this Agreement. e) Notwithstanding the terms
    of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any
    Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of
    such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary
    License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).


  3. REQUIREMENTS
  ---------------

  3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

    a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance
    with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a
    statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this
    Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner
    on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and b) the
    Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this
    Agreement, provided that such license:

      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
      warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
      conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
      conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii)
      effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability
      for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
      consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) does not attempt to
      limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section
      3.2; and iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
      party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this
      section 3.

  3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

    a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program

      (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made
      available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor
      attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this
      Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such
      Secondary Licenses, and

    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

  3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark,
  attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability
  (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which
  they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate
  notices.


  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
  --------------------------

  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
  respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
  intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
  includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
  manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
  Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
  offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend
  and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any
  losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims,
  lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
  Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
  Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in
  a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
  to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
  property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
  a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
  b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
  Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
  negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim
  at its own expense.

  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
  offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
  that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
  warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
  such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
  Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
  Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
  court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
  Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.


  5. NO WARRANTY
  --------------

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
  BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
  WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
  WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
  MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
  responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
  Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
  this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program
  errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
  or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.


  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
  --------------------------

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
  BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY
  LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER
  CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
  OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
  OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
  HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


  7. GENERAL
  ----------

  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
  remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
  parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
  necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
  (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
  infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
  under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
  comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
  does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
  aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
  terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
  soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
  Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
  continue and survive.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
  order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
  modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
  publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
  time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
  Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
  Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
  Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
  be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
  Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the
  Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
  the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program
  (including its Contributions) under the new version.

  Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
  receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
  Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel
  or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
  Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be
  enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No
  third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.


  Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
  ---------------------------------------------

  “This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary
  Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse
  Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and
  exceptions or additional permissions here}.”

    Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not
    sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

    If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
    then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
    relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
    notice.

    You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
